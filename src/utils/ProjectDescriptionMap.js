  foodLandingPage: [
    "The choice of theme for the site was made strategically. I wanted to test some of my CSS skills on a web page and decided to create a landing page. However, I also wanted this project to be something that would keep me engaged, not just a purposeless exercise. Therefore, I decided to focus on Japanese food, a passion of mine. I love cooking, and Japanese cuisine has always fascinated me.",
    "I developed the landing page with an artistic touch, using images and videos that give it a professional feel. The entire project was carried out by me: from researching the theme, selecting and editing images and videos, to designing the wireframe and coding the development.",
    "Being able to create functional, dynamic, and undoubtedly innovative components is what makes interfaces evoke that 'Wow, this is cool!' feeling in users, prompting them to explore the components even when there isn't a real need. I aimed to add a dash of this allure by incorporating the video/image component!",

  memoryGame: [
    "This was the second game I developed, following many guidelines from the first one to reinforce the knowledge I had acquired. It's a simple game, and I focused on using its simplicity to solidify essential concepts. The folder structure and components were carefully organized to adhere to best practices. Thus, even though it's 'just a memory game,' I managed to use the project well to expand some techniques.",
    "The game itself follows the traditional format, but I added a few elements I found interesting, such as difficulty levels and final animations. My aim is always to provide an engaging user experience (UX) that evokes emotions in the user. A simple, yet rich project.",
  ],
  ticTacToe: [
    "Developing the classic Tic-Tac-Toe was my first foray into the world of game development. I chose a simple and practical theme to get acquainted with React development. Although it was a quick project, completed in just a few hours, I spared no effort in researching and applying best practices.",
    "As soon as I finished, I was eager to embark on new challenges. It was hard to resist the temptation to add more features to the game. One of the ideas that excited me the most was to create a version to play against an artificial intelligence. Who knows, maybe that will become a reality in the future!",
  ],
  spotify: [
    "The main Spotify interface developed with TypeScript in React in a Next.js project. Developing the Spotify interface aimed primarily at proficiency in responsive layout and componentization using TypeScript.",
    "Using Spotify as a layout reference aims to reduce friction in screen assembly. We can simulate a design team's process and leverage a highly componentized project. This approach allows us to not only create a static page but also implement the entire structure of a large-scale project. Although it's just one screen, it serves as the backbone of the entire project.",
    "An intriguing aspect of this endeavor was the opportunity to fully componentize the project and explore how generic and comprehensive we could make it using React. Efficient modularization helped us avoid duplicated code and significantly sped up maintenance and enhancements, enabling quick adjustments in a single place.",

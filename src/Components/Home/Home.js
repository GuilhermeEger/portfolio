            The choice of theme for the site was made strategically. I wanted to
            test some of my CSS skills on a web page and decided to create a
            landing page. However, I also wanted this project to be something
            that would keep me engaged, not just a purposeless exercise.
            Therefore, I decided to focus on Japanese food, a passion of mine. I
            love cooking, and Japanese cuisine has always fascinated me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I developed the landing page with an artistic touch, using images
            and videos that give it a professional feel. The entire project was
            carried out by me: from researching the theme, selecting and editing
            images and videos, to designing the wireframe and coding the
            development.

            This was the second game I developed, following many guidelines from
            the first one to reinforce the knowledge I had acquired. It's a
            simple game, and I focused on using its simplicity to solidify
            essential concepts. The folder structure and components were
            carefully organized to adhere to best practices. Thus, even though
            it's "just a memory game," I managed to use the project well to
            expand some techniques.
          </p>
          <p>
            The game itself follows the traditional format, but I added a few
            elements I found interesting, such as difficulty levels and final
            animations. My aim is always to provide an engaging user experience
            (UX) that evokes emotions in the user. A simple, yet rich project.

            Developing the classic Tic-Tac-Toe was my first foray into the world
            of game development. I chose a simple and practical theme to get
            acquainted with React development. Although it was a quick project,
            completed in just a few hours, I spared no effort in researching and
            applying best practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            As soon as I finished, I was eager to embark on new challenges. It
            was hard to resist the temptation to add more features to the game.
            One of the ideas that excited me the most was to create a version to
            play against an artificial intelligence. Who knows, maybe that will
            become a reality in the future!

          These are some of the screens from one of the projects I developed for
          my former company. It was a React Native application, but I used it
          merely as a "shell," with all development done responsively via the
          web, through a webview!
        </p>
        <p>
          The strategy behind this was that we were a rapidly growing startup,
          and I needed to implement functionalities efficiently and extremely
          quickly. By keeping the entire application in React Native, we could
          potentially face delays in rolling out new versions to clients through
          the Apple/Play store. With the use of webview, we could deploy
          updates, and within minutes, all clients would have access to the new
          frontend!
        </p>
        <p>
        Additionally, this decision was also motivated by the learning curve. By focusing on React.js, I could potentially develop screens for the web/desktop system in the future ;)
